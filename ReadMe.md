## How to run:
Be in root directory: FacePass/
1. pip install -r requirements.txt to install all requirements. Python 3.12 recommended
2. Create a folder named models and add your images into it
3. Download the models from the links given in refs.txt and add them in models
4. To run the program: python3 FacePass.py


## Future work:
1. Make a better database or use existing ones like FAISS
2. Make a user interface so that the adminstrator can registor new users into the database
3. For now the threshold value seems to be working fine but further tweaking and fine tuning is required
